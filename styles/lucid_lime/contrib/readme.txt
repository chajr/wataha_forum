Lucid Lime - Contact Info
-------------------------

Hello! Thank you for choosing Lucid Lime for your phpBB setup. If you experience any issues with the style,
you can contact me at the following address:

	dampening@gmail.com


Note that while I'm glad to support the style in a vanilla context, I can't offer the same assistance with
issues arising from the use of other third-party mods. If you use external tools on your board, please contact
their respective developpers for help with any related problems. If in doubt, let me know and I'll get back to
you as soon as possible.

That said, cheers, and enjoy the style!

Eric
